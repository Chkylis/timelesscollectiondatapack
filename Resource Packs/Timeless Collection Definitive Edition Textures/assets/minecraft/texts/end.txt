§3Hello, PLAYERNAME.

§3I see you have overcome the trial that is Riven of a Thousand Voices…

§3Your journey has not yet come to close, for this is only the beginning.

§3But in this brief moment, of temporary peace and calming bliss, you may rest.

§3Now, Let me tell you how this all began…

§3Open your ears, and listen, O’ reader mine.



§2A long time ago, there was the one known as the creator of this story you have just played, this creator had will given form, in the name of Henry Triason.

§2Henry Triason would come to be known as the leading intellectual of his time, but such praise would be fleeting.

§2Soon Henry’s life would be plunged into a realm of disorder and chaos, a world filled with the powers of the Alignments.

§2Much time would pass, and Henry would come to learn his true power as the Timeless Complexity.

§2As the Timeless Complexity, Henry would bring about an event causing the Multiverse to shatter…

§3And here we are, the byproduct of the Multiverse’s boundaries being broken.

§3You have only seen the beginning of what disorder was caused by these events, with Riven slain, you must take the pieces cast aside by the battle and rebuild.

§3The End is only the beginning…

§3But not all journeys have to end so soon. What comes next is up to you...

§3Where will you go now, PLAYERNAME?

You have waited this long.

I shall reveal the secrets of this world to you, so open your ears.

If you have gotten thus far, then you are truly worthy.

There is a blade, one not of this universe.

It requires nine shards, the recipes for these shards are displayed in the yellow text.

If you can acquire all of these shards, reality can be whatever you want it to be.

And for those who already know...

I'll be seeing you...

Very soon.
