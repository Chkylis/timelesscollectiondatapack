Jimothy, Stick Incarnate.
Colonel, I am trying to sneak through the enemy base, but I'm dummy thicc, and the clap of my cheeks keeps alerting the guards
Nanomachines, son.
Determination, Human.
Mining away, I don't know what to mine, I'll mine this anyways!
You're gonna have to try harder than THAT.
Been spending most their lives, livin' in a Morshu's Paradise.
They say you can disable a Guardian by destroying its legs.
Wizzrobes although rare, are very rewarding to seek out.
They say Spamton's shop is the key to becoming very wealthy.
They say there is a blade for those who acquire a large sum of items.
Buying the bedrock potion from Peris might be more rewarding than you think.
Overshield armor, while expensive, is well worth it.
The Fierce Deity armor may weaken the user, but even bosses fear its dark powers.
Very rarely, a mob can spawn with a chance at dropping exotium.
Fear him, for he is the wrath of the skies and seas.
You never know what easter eggs may appear from renaming things!
The Devil's Knife true potential can only be used by experts of the craft.
They say there is an achievement for accomplishing everything, but is there really?
Energy is the currency of power, use it wisely.
Some wonder why the ancient blade's text is red.
Don't engage with counterfeit currency, Billiam's deals outweigh the competition.
Not all paintings are vanilla, some contain references!
The wither can rarely reward its effort in gold.
The infinitely long path, is not so infinite, once the first ender dragon is slain.
Some armor sets and items have hidden powers, can you find them all?
They say those who find comfort in parting, will be rewarded.
The secret to becoming very powerful lies in the orb.
Not all Guardians stalk you.
:loaf:
It's Boshy Time!
Oh the Misery!
Everybody wants to be my Enemy!
Determination.
SPEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEENNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN!
SPEEN!
Sometimes you have to run, before you can walk.
I, Giorno Giovanna, have a dream.
ZA WARUDO!
ORA! ORA! ORA! ORA! ORA! ORA! ORA!
MUDA! MUDA! MUDA! MUDA! MUDA! MUDA! MUDA!
